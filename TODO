-   Instead of setting tags to fixed string, allow substitutions using regular
    expressions (think: sed command on title tag).  Can this not already be
    done with command line? Probably, but clumsy (tag file --artist `tag file |
    grep "artist:" | sed -e 's...'`)

-   Ability to delete tag

-   Ability to edit any textual tag (e.g. Album Artist, Composer, ...)
